      <p>In 2015, the original <cite>DITA-OT Markdown</cite> plug-in introduced a series of conventions to facilitate
        conversion of Markdown content to DITA, and vice-versa. This Markdown flavor was called <cite>Markdown
          DITA</cite>, a representation of DITA content in Markdown. This format served as the foundation for the
        toolkitâ€™s Markdown support, and has since evolved further.</p>
      <p>In 2017, the original Markdown plug-in was superseded by the <cite>LwDITA</cite> plug-in, which was bundled
        with DITA-OT 3.0, and adds additional features to support Lightweight DITA, including the <cite>MDITA</cite>
        format proposed in the latest specification drafts.</p>
